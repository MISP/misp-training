## Involved parties
One or more members of:
- Retail and Hospitality ISAC (**RH-ISAC**): Retailers, restaurants, hotels, ...
- **Space ISAC**: Space sector organization, Satellite operators, space agencies, ...
- Top-Level Domain ISAC (**TLD-ISAC**): Registries, DNS Operators, ...
- Consumer Data Industry Association (**CDA-ISAC**): Consumer data industry, credit reporting agencies, data brokers, ...
- Aviation ISAC (**A-ISAC**): Airlines, airports, manufacturers, ...

## Chronology of Events

- **Day 1** - **Spear Phishing Campaign**
    - **RH-ISAC** members are hit by a simple spear-phishing campaign
    - The phishing emails contain a malicious attachment that installs a backdoor
    - Their infrastructure is used to send a second wave of phishing email targeting Space ISAC
- **Day 2** - **Second Spear Phishing Wave**
    - **RH-ISAC** members notice unusual traffic originating from their infrastructure
    - They notify **Space ISAC**'s member about the campaign and potential compromise
- **Day 3** - **Exploit on Known Vulnerability and Phishing websites**
    - **TLD-ISAC** members are targeted by a known vulnerability on an unpatched exposed software giving access to TLD registry's systems.
    - DNS record for **RH** and **space** sector are manipulated to cloned phishing pages
    - **CDA-ISAC** members are impacted as well and a cloned website is used to steal personal information
- **Day 4** - **Disruptions and ISACs collaboration**
    - Stolen identities are used to disrupt operations and perform unauthorized purchases
    - All ISACs collaborates together to mitigates and stop the attacks

#### Summary of the whole campaign:
1. Spear-phishing campaign 1 + backdoor
2. Spear-phishing campaign 2 + backdoor
3. Vulnerable software is exploited
4. DNS record are changed

## Evidence Collected

- **Malicious Email Attachment**: Malicious file attached to the spear phishing emails
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Evidence of C2 communication after the backdoor installation
- **Backdoor installation**: The backdoor identified on compromised systems
- **Known Vulnerability**: Exploit code use to attack the known vulnerability
- **Redirected DNS Logs**: Logs showing unauthorized DNS changes

## Data Extracted from Evidence (IoCs)

- **IP Addresses**
    - `195.208.152.43`: IP address of the C2 server associated with the backdoor communication
    - `80.72.225.30`: IPs linked to the malicious sites used in DNS redirection
- **Domain Names**
    - Known URLs used for the C2 server so far
        - `https://c2.intgmx.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.axwscw.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.kgodir.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.nvbvod.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.qpdjrn.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.isannt.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.pofkwn.deadnxuyla.ru`
        - `https://c2.xlalfg.deadnxuyla.ru`
    - Malicious domain where traffic was redirected after DNS manipulation
        - `secure-pay.com`
        - `secure-book.com`
- **Algorithm used to pick the next C2 domain**
    - Reversed algorithm from the backdoor
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    generate_domain() {
        static_prefix="https://c2."
        static_suffix=".deadnxuyla.ru"

        random_part=$(tr -dc 'a-z' < /dev/urandom | head -c 6)

        domain="${static_prefix}${random_part}${static_suffix}"
        echo $domain
    }
    ```
- **Rules to block traffic to these domains**
    - Suricata rule
    ```suricata
    drop ip any any -> any any (msg:"Block traffic to specific domains"; content:"deadnxuyla.ru"; pcre:"/c2\.[a-z]{6}-deadnxuyla\.ru/"; sid:100001;)
    ```
    - iptables Rule
    ```text
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m string --string "deadnxuyla.ru" --algo bm -j REJECT
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m string --string "deadnxuyla.ru" --algo bm -j REJECT
    ```
- **Payloads and Exploit code**
    - [`Account_Verification.docx.exe`](https://cra.circl.lu/Account_Verification.docx.exe)
    - [`exploit-exposed-software.sh`](https://cra.circl.lu/exploit-exposed-software.sh)
- **Registry Keys**
    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\MSCall PublicKey`: Registry key containing the backdoor configuration
- **Public Key**
    - `0x281A77EA`: The XOR key received from the C2 to encrypt known C2 domains. Collected through network interception.

## Tasks
1. Create a new Event
2. Encode all data: Both Indicators (IoCs) and Supportive Data
3. Add few relationships
4. Perform enrichments where applicable
5. Add context
    - **Releasability** and **Permissible Actions**
    - **Adversary infrastructure**
    - **Adversary tactics and techniques**
6. Review the Distribution Levels
    - Shared with **All**:
        - **C2 IP Address**
        - **Malicious Domain Names** and **Reversed Algorithm**
        - **Remediation scripts**
        - **Email Attachment**
        - **Spearphishing Email**
    - Shared with a **Subset of ISACs**:
        - **Exploit code** for the unpatched exposed software
        - **Redirected DNS Logs**
    - Kept internal:
        - **Spearphishing victims**
7. Publish the Event
