 \frametitle{MISP and starting from a practical use-case}
 \begin{itemize}
         \item During a malware analysis workgroup in 2012, we discovered that we worked on the analysis of the same malware.
         \item We wanted to share information in an easy and automated way {\bf to avoid duplication of work}.
         \item Christophe Vandeplas (then working at the CERT for the Belgian MoD) showed us his work on a platform that later became MISP.
         \item A first version of the MISP Platform was used by the MALWG and {\bf the increasing feedback of users} helped us to build an improved platform.
         \item MISP is now {\bf a community-driven development}.
 \end{itemize}

\frametitle{about CIRCL}
	The Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) is a government-driven initiative designed to provide a systematic response facility to computer security threats and incidents. CIRCL is a CERT with national responsibilities for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg and is operated by LHC (Luxembourg House of Cybersecurity).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MISP and CIRCL}
\begin{itemize}
\item CIRCL is mandated by the Ministry of Economy and acting as the Luxembourg National CERT for private sector.
\item CIRCL leads the development of the Open Source MISP threat intelligence platform which is used by many military or intelligence communities, private companies, financial sector, National CERTs and LEAs globally.
\item {\bf CIRCL runs multiple large MISP communities performing active daily threat-intelligence sharing}.

\frametitle{What is MISP?}
\begin{itemize}
       \item MISP is a {\bf threat information sharing} platform that is free \& open source software
       \item A tool that {\bf collects} information from partners, your analysts, your tools, feeds
       \item Normalises, {\bf correlates}, {\bf enriches} the data
       \item Allows teams and communities to {\bf collaborate}
       \item {\bf Feeds} automated protective tools and analyst tools with the output
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Development based on practical user feedback}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are many different types of users of an information sharing platform like MISP:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Malware reversers} willing to share indicators of analysis with respective colleagues.
                \item {\bf Security analysts} searching, validating and using indicators in operational security.
                \item {\bf Intelligence analysts} gathering information about specific adversary groups.
                \item {\bf Law-enforcement} relying on indicators to support or bootstrap their DFIR cases.
                \item {\bf Risk analysis teams} willing to know about the new threats, likelyhood and occurences.
                \item {\bf Fraud analysts} willing to share financial indicators to detect financial frauds.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Many objectives from different user-groups}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Sharing indicators for a {\bf detection} matter.
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item 'Do I have infected systems in my infrastructure or the ones I operate?'
                        \end{itemize}
                \item Sharing indicators to {\bf block}.
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item 'I use these attributes to block, sinkhole or divert traffic.'
                        \end{itemize}
                \item Sharing indicators to {\bf perform intelligence}.
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item 'Gathering information about campaigns and attacks. Are they related? Who is targeting me? Who are the adversaries?'
                        \end{itemize}
                \item $\rightarrow$ These objectives can be conflicting (e.g. False-positives have different impacts)
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Communities using MISP}
 \begin{itemize}
	 \item Communities are groups of users sharing within a set of common objectives/values.
	 \item CIRCL operates multiple MISP instances with a significant user base (more than 1200 organizations with more than 4000 users).
         \item {\bf Trusted groups} running MISP communities in island mode (air gapped system) or partially connected mode.
	 \item {\bf Financial sector} (banks, ISACs, payment processing organizations) use MISP as a sharing mechanism.
	 \item {\bf Military and international organizations} (NATO, military CSIRTs, n/g CERTs,...).
	 \item {\bf Security vendors} running their own communities (e.g. Fidelis) or interfacing with MISP communities (e.g. OTX).
         \item {\bf Topical communities} set up to tackle individual specific issues (COVID-19 MISP)
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Sharing Difficulties}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Sharing difficulties are not really technical issues but often it's a matter of {\bf social interactions} (e.g. {\bf trust}).
                \item Legal restriction\footnote{\url{https://www.misp-project.org/compliance/}}
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item "Our legal framework doesn't allow us to share information."
                                \item "Risk of information-leak is too high and it's too risky for our organization or partners."
                        \end{itemize}
                \item Practical restriction
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item "We don't have information to share."
                                \item "We don't have time to process or contribute indicators."
                                \item "Our model of classification doesn't fit your model."
                                \item "Tools for sharing information are tied to a specific format, we use a different one."
                        \end{itemize}

        \frametitle{Terminology about Indicators}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Indicators\footnote{IoC (Indicator of Compromise) is a subset of indicators}
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item Indicators contain a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
                        \end{itemize}
                \item Attributes in MISP can be network indicators (e.g. IP address), system indicators (e.g. a string in memory) or even bank account details.
                \begin{itemize}
                        \item {\bf A type (e.g. MD5, url) is how an attribute is described}.
                \end{itemize}
                \begin{itemize}
                \item An attribute is always in a category (e.g. Payload delivery) which puts it in a context.
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item {\bf A category is what describes} an attribute.
                        \end{itemize}
                \item An IDS flag on an attribute allows to determine if {\bf an attribute can be automatically used for detection}.
                \end{itemize}

                \item The format of the OSINT feed is based on standard MISP JSON output pulled from a remote TLS/HTTP server.
                \item Additional content providers can provide their own MISP feeds. (\url{https://botvrij.eu/})
                \item Allows users to {\bf test their MISP installations and synchronisation with a real dataset}.
                \item Opening contribution to other threat intel feeds but also allowing the analysis of overlapping data\footnote{A recurring challenge in information sharing}.

        \frametitle{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Information sharing practices come from usage} and by example (e.g. learning by imitation from the shared information).
                \item MISP is just a tool. What matters is your sharing practices. The tool should be as transparent as possible to support you.
                \item Enable users to customize MISP to meet their community's use-cases.
                \item MISP project combines open source software, open standards, best practices and communities to make information sharing a reality.
