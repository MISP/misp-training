\section{MISP}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is MISP?}
\begin{itemize}
       \item MISP is an OSS {\bf threat information sharing} platform (TISP)
       \item A tool used and deployed by CSIRTs, SOCs, Cyber threat researchers around the world
       \item The main objective is {\bf collective defense} against threats
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{MISP: Started from a practical use-case}
 \begin{itemize}
         \item During a malware analysis workgroup in 2012, we discovered that we worked on the analysis of the same malware.
         \item We wanted to share information in an easy and automated way {\bf to avoid duplication of work}.
         \item Christophe Vandeplas (then working at the CERT for the Belgian MoD) showed us his work on a platform that later became MISP.
         \item A first version of the MISP Platform was used by the MALWG and {\bf the increasing feedback of users} helped us to build an improved platform.
         \item MISP is now {\bf a community-driven development} supporting different intelligence communities.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Development based on practical user feedback}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organic growth over time within security teams:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Malware reversers}: share indicators of analysis with colleagues.
                \item {\bf Security analysts} searching, validating and using indicators in ops.
                \item {\bf Intelligence analysts} researching adversary groups.
                \item {\bf Risk analysis teams} monitoring trends, threats, remediations.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Some examples of other communities picking up MISP:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Financial sector}: sharing financial indicators, fraud information.
                \item {\bf Law-enforcement}: bootstrapping DFIR cases, non-cyber-threats, border control, etc
                \item {\bf Military} sharing highly specialised information.
                \item {\bf Disinformation research}: Election interference, disinfo campaigns, etc.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Objectives of MISP in more detail}      
\begin{itemize}
       \item A tool that {\bf collects threat information} from partners, your analysts, your tools, sensors, feeds
       \item Normalises, {\bf correlates}, {\bf enriches} the data
       \item Manages your processes and automates tasks such as {\bf notifications}, {\bf data flow management}, {\bf triaging} and so on
       \item Allows teams and communities to {\bf collaborate} and rapidly {\bf exchange knowledge}
       \item {\bf Feeds} automated protective tools and analyst tools with the output
       \item {\bf Presents} both individualised and community centric facts, trends, reports of the intelligence
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A bit more details about the MISP software}      
\begin{itemize}
       \item {\bf OSS}, hosted on github with a very active developer and user community behind it
       \item Users can either: 
       \begin{itemize}
           \item {\bf deploy their own MISPs}
           \item {\bf Join an existing MISP instance} hosted by someone else
       \end{itemize}
       \item MISP instances can be {\bf interconnected}, creating networks with different topologies (mesh, hub/spoke, hybrid)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is the MISP-project?}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Besides being a a web application, the MISP-project also contains the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A set of {\bf open standards} (implemented by MISP and other tools)
            \item An {\bf ecosystem} of libraries, supporting tools
            \item A collection of guidance and best practice documentation by practitioners
        \end{itemize}
        \item All of these are free \& open source
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{How can this be relevant to you?}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why should you care?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You're looking to improve your security posture
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If you have a {\bf security team / operations team} looking for threat intel
            \item If you would like to {\bf automate} your security processes
            \item If you are dealing with security {\bf incidents} and would like to {\bf collaborate}
        \end{itemize}
        \item If you're looking for ways to overcome internal challenges
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We've been building this by now rather complex application since 2012
            \item Long list of {\bf libraries, techniques, ideas} that can be reused
            \item Well established standards for information exchange
            \item Can be adapted to completely {\bf different sharing use-cases} you may have
